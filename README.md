# SimCIM

Simple implementation of SimCIM algorythm attempting to solve Max-Cut and Minimal-balanced-cut graph partitioning problems. 
Mathematical description is given in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08927.pdf
and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.5843.pdf

Use "SimCIM algorythm.py" file to try how it works.

The other .py file is made just to try some graph operations.
