# Graph-Exercises

Simple implementation of SimCIM algorythm attempting to solve Max-Cut graph partitioning problem. 
Mathematical description is given in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08927.pdf

Use SimCIM algorythm.py file to try how it works.

The other .py file is made just to try some graph operations.
